# wineyes3d
Reimplementation of xeyes/wineyes for win32 that uses OpenGL and desktop compositing. Requires Windows 8 and, currently, an intel graphic accelerator (due to transparency issues on discrete cards).

The eyes can be resized after clicking. Window size and position is stored in Registry. There is no exit function.
