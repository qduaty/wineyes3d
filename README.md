# wineyes3d
Reimplementation of xeyes/wineyes for win32 that uses OpenGL and desktop compositing. Requires Windows 8 or newer.

The eyes can be resized after clicking. Window size and position is stored in Registry. The program is considered a tool (for a multi-monitor setup), so there is no exit function.

Developers: if you want to borrow some code, please examine the links to original authors because they may have better licenses (mine is currently GPL3).
